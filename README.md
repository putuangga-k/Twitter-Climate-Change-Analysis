## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that analyzes public sentiment and discussions around climate change on Twitter. The project leverages sentiment analysis techniques to understand how users express their opinions about climate change and tracks trends over time.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on tweets related to climate change, identifying whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. By analyzing this data, we aim to provide insights into public opinion and potential shifts in attitudes towards climate change.

## Technology Used
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scikitlearn
- Seaborn

## Files

- **Twitter Climate Change Analysis.ipynb**: The main notebook containing the code for data collection, processing, sentiment analysis, and visualization.
